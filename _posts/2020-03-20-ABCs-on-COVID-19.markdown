Hello guys, since Jan 20 I have been following and collecting news, official guidelines and academic papers on the neo-coronaries (COVID-19) outburst. Now the situation is getting serious and there is the tendency of it developing into a global pandemic (see [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-in-all-but-name-says-expert and here: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00551-1; Source in German: https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikobewertung.html)).

Thus I have decided to share information and websites I have found useful with you if you are interested in understanding 1. what is COVID-19; 2. how to prevent getting infected. It is important to get some ABCs on it as it has been confirmed in cases in China that **once getting infected, even if there are little or no symptoms, one can still spread the virus to others. One can also get infected and self-cured without noticing while still transmitting the disease to others** (see [this](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-confirmed-patients-can-transmit-the-coronavirus-without-showing-symptoms) and [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic.html)). The mortality rate is quite high for the elderly and people who have weak immune systems or have chronic diseases (see [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GOKBuHY63u4bhGSzAfCA0w) in Chinese), so only for being responsible for the weak and sick, it’s better to not get yourself infected.   

Information is mainly collected from WHO and official gov websites (China, US, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany), major English, Chinese, German news agencies, as well as Chinese doctors and expert volunteer communities. As I have NEVER attended medical school and I am NO expert on this disease, all information is just for your reference. I will provide as many source links as possible. For sources in Chinese, I translated them in a short time and please excuse me for being not professional at all. It is important for you to read the translated parts as it contains info that is missing in WHO or other major sources. If you have a medical background and would like to help me edit it, please do not hesitate to contact me. My email: azurelavender@gmail.com

Why do we need to take the COVID-19 epidemic-pandemic (to be) seriously?

Some argue that the COVID-19 is not as deadly or as bad as influenza, i.e. it has caused less death numbers than influenza, thus we do not need to panic. I also agree that we do not need to panic about it. But I believe remaining calm should be a result of understanding the virus and the disease properly from reliable information sources, not by ignoring the facts, which is out there in other parts of the world or in scientific communities. To have a better idea about it is the best way to stay away from panicking and stress. Here below I will list my arguments that people should be more cautious rather careless.

We still have much yet to know about the COVID-19. Now scientists in China have evidence to believe that the “patient zero” or the first case already existed before December, 2019 (link will follow). In the past few months the outbreak was mainly in China, especially in Hubei province.
As local, provincial, and central governments of China often lack transparency, the total scale of disease, the death number and thus the global mortality rate (which is heavily based on data from China so far) needs further calibration to reach a better accuracy. As the situation was so severe in Hubei province for the past 1.5 months, esp. In Wuhan city, many people, even family after family did not get proper diagnosis and died without officially being categorized as COVID-19 patients. These cases were never calculated into the official mortality rate (links will follow, Chinese source mainly). Not to mention if one is categorized only as a suspected COVID-19 case and died, he/she will also not be calculated. No matter the numbers or rates reported by Chinese authorities are intentionally manipulated or are out of statistical error caused by lack of capacity and experience, you should understand that the numbers and figures are not final and need further investigation.
On the contrary, influenza has been with human society for ages, we know a lot more about influenza and we have vaccines developed every year to prevent it. It has a season and most cases will disappear after Spring. We are not sure about the COVID-19, whether or not it will disappear when the temperature rises.
Another point I need to address is that the rates and numbers of flu patients in different countries are generated based on different medical standards. Actually the mortality rate of influenza is lower in China than in US, only because in the US, their calculation includes people who died because of complication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)) of flu infection (source needed), while in China they don’t. Thus you’d better put a question mark on such comparisons.
So far according to the statistics, COVID-19 is quite contiguous but less lethal than SARS (link will follow). But the lesson we can learn from Wuhan is that we should try to contain it. If less people get infected, then even less could develop into severe symptoms that require hospitalization or even ICU. I believe the main reason that the mortality rate in Wuhan/Hubei is relatively high compared to the rest of China/world is too many people got infected in a short period of time, resulting the medical care system’ breakdown and it failed to 1. hospitalize all patients with severe symptoms; 2. offer proper treatments for all hospitalized patients 2. contain patients with light symptoms or no symptoms but who are able to further transmit the virus to a larger crowd. Please also see risk assessment published by RKI: “A coincidence with the current wave of influenza in Germany should also be avoided as far as possible, as this could lead to a maximum strain on the medical care structures. (https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikobewertung.html?nn=13490888).” As I mentioned in page 1, I believe it’s our responsibility to try not to get infected and not be a member of patients that is going to create difficulties for medical care systems.
It is in this sense I am putting information together for you.


# II. Transmission
See the above WHO video: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019;
US CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html
Advice for public published by Chinese CDC (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GOKBuHY63u4bhGSzAfCA0w):
 Close contact with respiratory droplets that produced by patient’s sneeze and cough; or inhaling directly the patient’s exhaled air, which also contains respiratory droplets,
Via aerosol: See: https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049623/coronavirus-hubei-province-reports-81-new-deaths-and-2841 and https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-51427216 (unfortunately you need to google-auto-translate this BBC news report from Chinese to English)
Respiratory droplets land on the surface of objects (\*note from me: esp. smooth surface, the virus can live longer on a smooth surface other than harsh surface), then by touching the surface (by one’s hand for example) later gets transmitted by further touching one’s eyes, nose, or mouth.

# III. Symptoms
WHO video: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019;
US CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html
Advice for public published by Chinese CDC (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GOKBuHY63u4bhGSzAfCA0w):
                    Most common symptoms:
shortness of breath or difficult to breathe + fever (above 37.5)
coughing without phlegm.
weakness
                    Other less common symptoms:
Almost no obvious symptom: no fever or pneumonia (yet has the potential to infect others)
Running nose
Diarrhea and/or nausea
Palpitation and/or respiratory distress
Conjunctivitis/Pink Eye
Muscle soreness in arms, legs, and waist


# IV. Prevention
In general (mainly based on guides published in Chinese):
Wash your hand frequently and thoroughly.
Keep distance with people who are sneezing or coughing (1-2 meters); Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose once you are outside; Bring a hand sanitizer and keep your hand clean if possible; Wash your hand right after coming back home  (\*use disinfectant spray that contains at least 60-70% alcohol to wipe your phone and door handle after back home--only if you find it’s necessary).
If possible, avoid crowded areas.
SO FAR (by 26/02/2020): Avoid unnecessary travel to affected areas: Wuhan and/or Hubei province, China; South Korea, esp. Daegu and Gyeongbuk Province. Also try to avoid traveling to other cities in mainland China, Italy (esp. Lombardy and Veneto regions), Japan, Singapore (\*notes from me: and also maybe Iran).
Wear a mask properly if you find it’s necessary (most advice outside China suggest not to wear masks when you are healthy and not taking care of any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infected patient).

On wearing masks:
Again, washing hands is more important than wearing masks.
How to choose masks?
In China and in many other East Asian countries, it is quite common to wear a mask if one is sick (to prevent infecting others) or if one wants to avoid getting sick. Here below under this numbered list are recommendations based on Chinese sources:
Wear a mask in crowded areas or public areas, a single use surgical mask is sufficient (if it’s single use, avoid using it for multiple times. If one has to use it for multiple times, check the relevant links below)
Save FFP3/N95 level masks for health and medical workers.

I briefly translated a section of a pdf manual published by doctor volunteers in China on how to protect yourself during the outbreak of COVID-19, with guidance on how to wear and dispose of face masks (a few points are missing in the WHO guide). I will send the pdf separately. Also here are two links from the pdf: San Fransico Dept. of Public Health: How to Put on and Remove a Face Mask https://www.sfcdcp.org/communicable-disease/healthy-habits/how-to-put-on-and-remove-a-face-mask/ and https://www.mountainside-medical.com/pages/how-to-properly-dispose-of-a-face-mask for your reference.

# V. Academic and scientific articles on COVID-19.
You can read the abstract to get a general idea about it.
Periodical report from Imperial College London-Report 6: “we estimated that about two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, potentially resulting in multiple chains of as yet undetected human-to-human transmission outside mainland China.” https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College---COVID-19---Relative-Sensitivity-International-Cases.pdf



Be safe and stay healthy.
